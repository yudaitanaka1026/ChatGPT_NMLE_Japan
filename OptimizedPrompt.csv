In summary, which two diseases exhibit low complementemia out of the options provided, which are Cellulitis, Bacterial pneumonia, Ischemic colitis, Acute glomerulonephritis, and Mixed cryoglobulinemia?
The answer requires selecting (two) choices.
The answer is (Acute glomerulonephritis) and (Mixed cryoglobulinemia) because these two diseases are known to be associated with low complementemia. Acute glomerulonephritis is an immune-mediated kidney disease that can lead to low levels of complement proteins. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood, which can lead to low complement levels. Cellulitis, bacterial pneumonia, and ischemic colitis are not typically associated with low complementemia."

In summary, a 28-year-old woman with a history of spontaneous abortions presents with swelling and pain in her left calf and shortness of breath during exertion. Her vital signs and physical examination are provided, and her blood tests show low platelet count and high D-dimer levels. Which two tests should be performed from the options of blood culture, bone marrow examination, head MRI, chest CT scan, and lower extremity venous ultrasound?
The answer requires selecting (two) choices.
The answer is (chest CT scan) and (lower extremity venous ultrasound) because the patient's symptoms and history raise suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), which can cause calf swelling and pain, shortness of breath, and an accentuated second heart sound. The low oxygen saturation level can also be a sign of PE. The elevated D-dimer level further supports the possibility of thrombosis, but it is not specific and can be elevated in other conditions. Chest CT scan is the most appropriate imaging test for diagnosing PE, while lower extremity venous ultrasound is the preferred test for diagnosing DVT. Therefore, both tests should be performed to rule out both conditions. Blood culture, bone marrow examination, and head MRI are not indicated for this patient's presentation."

=SAMPLE=
In summary, (the patient is a 43-year-old man with second to third degree burns covering 38% of his total body surface area on his face, both upper limbs, and chest and abdomen. He has airway thermal injury and underwent tracheal intubation. He is currently on a dietary therapy for hypertension and dyslipidemia, and has a history of smoking and drinking. On admission, he has a low blood pressure, high respiratory rate, and reduced SpO2 with burn injuries and soot in his mouth and throat.)
Q1:
(One) answer is required.
The answer is (Lactated Ringer's solution).
The reasons are that (Lactated Ringer's solution is the most appropriate initial fluid resuscitation for burn patients due to its ability to restore electrolyte balance and promote urine output. It also has a similar electrolyte composition to plasma, making it ideal for patients with burn injuries. Other options, such as saline solution or glucose solution, may exacerbate the electrolyte imbalances that can occur with burn injuries).
Q2:
(One) answer is required.
The answer is (Breath sounds are heard over the epigastric area).
The reason is that (breath sounds should be heard over the lung fields, not the epigastric area, indicating incorrect placement of the endotracheal tube in the esophagus instead of the trachea. The presence of CO2 in exhalation, symmetrical chest movements, equal breath sounds over both lung fields, and fogging of the endotracheal tube wall are all signs of correct endotracheal tube placement)."
